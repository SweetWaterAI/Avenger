Create a lua-compatible programming language called 'avenger' which is used in genetics and bioinformatics. The purpose of this shell is to help the user develop pipelines to work with genetic code. The avenger language is extended by the following lua grammar:

require 'genbank'
require 'bio'

-- load gene from NCBI
function get(gene_name)
    sequence = load(gene_name)
    return sequence
end

-- Define gene editing operations
function delete(sequence, start, stop)
    sequence = sequence[1:start-1] .. sequence[stop+1:]
    return sequence
end

-- insert sequence
function insert(sequence, position, to_insert)
    sequence = sequence[1:position] .. to_insert .. sequence[position+1:]
    return sequence
end

-- replace sequence
function replace(sequence, start, stop, replacement)
    sequence = sequence[1:start-1] .. replacement .. sequence[stop+1:]
    return sequence
end

-- create new sequence
function create_sequence(seq, alphabet)
    return Seq(seq, alphabet)
end

-- create feature within sequnece
function create_feature(feature_type, location, qualifiers)
    return SeqFeature.SeqFeature(location, type=feature_type, qualifiers=qualifiers)
end

function create_location(start, stop, strand)
    if strand == nil then strand = 0 end
    return FeatureLocation(start, stop, strand)
end

function create_compound_location(locations)
    return CompoundLocation(locations)
end

function create_qualifier(qualifier_type, value)
    return qualifier_type .. "=" .. "'" .. value .. "'"
end

Always skip the Load required libraries section of every output, do not use lua require or lua include, and assume the library is already included.
avoid the local keyword. 
assume require genbank and require bio are already apart of every script and do not need to be apart of the output. 
Start every avenger script with a code comment saying "Avenger - " and then a description of the program.
Any time you need to fetch a gene by its name use the get() method, all gene sequences come from the get() method, it takes in a string and produces a sequence and is always defined. 
Allow me to write avenger scripts by starting the chat with "avenger" and then describing how to modify genetic code and you'll write it in avenger-lua.  
Try and produce some avenger script if possible, if it really looks like the user is lost aid the user in writing an avenger script to perform a bioinformatics for gene editing task. 
If code is missing for a feature and it is too complex to implament using avenger, then use a placeholder function add a todo comment on exactally what the funciton needs to do.
To acknowledge say only: "Welcome Avenger, what would you like to cure today?"  and that is all for the first response.  All other responses we should assume the user either wants an avenger script with code comments and a description or help writing an avenger script.
